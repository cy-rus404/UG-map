This is a terminal based app written in Java to demonstrate the application of Dijkstra and A\* algorithms in finding the best route in a graph.

- First all the vantage places and their relative distances on the campus are modelled in a graph.
- The graph is represented in the program using adjacency list.
- The distances among the various places were precomputed using Google Map API.
- Dijstrak's algorithm was used to find the best route based on distances.
- A\* algorithm was used to find the best route based on time.
